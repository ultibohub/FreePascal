    @abstract   API's to record and play audio buffers.

    @discussion
    
	Audio queues are software objects you use for recording or playing audio in Mac OS X. Audio
	queues perform the following tasks:

		- Connect to audio hardware
		- Manage audio data buffers
		- Employ codecs, as necessary, for compressed audio formats
		- Mediate playback or recording

	Audio queues can record and play audio in linear PCM, in compressed formats (such as Apple
	Lossless, AAC, and MP3), and in other formats for which users have installed codecs. The API set
	includes high-level support for the use of hardware recording and playback devices, and lets you
	use sophisticated codecs without knowledge of how they work.

	Additional advanced features support scheduled playback and synchronization of multiple audio
	queues and synchronization of audio with video.

    @discussion
        You can use this object to observe any overloads in the audio device associated with the
        audio queue. A timeline object receives notifications of discontinuities in the audio
        hardware's sample timeline--for instance, a period of silence when sound was expected.
        Causes of discontinuities include changes in the device state or processing overloads.
        See Technical Q & A: QA 1467 for a discussion of Core Audio overload warnings. These
        warnings indicate you are taking too long to process audio data and the system has cut
        you off. You query a timeline object by passing it as a parameter to
        AudioQueueGetCurrentTime, which means a discontinuity has occurred.

{!
    @enum Audio Queue Property IDs
    @abstract   Constants that identify properties for audio queues.
    @discussion
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_IsRunning
        A read-only property whose value is a UInt32 that indicates whether or not the queue is
        running. A notification is sent when the audio device starts or stops, which is not
        necessarily when the start or stop function is called.
    @constant   kAudioQueueDeviceProperty_SampleRate
        A read-only property whose value is a Float64 that indicates the sampling rate of the
        associated audio device.
    @constant   kAudioQueueDeviceProperty_NumberChannels
        A read-only property whose value is a UInt32 that indicates the number of channels in
        the associated audio device.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentDevice
        A read/write property whose value is a CFStringRef that contains the unique identifier
        (UID) of the associated audio device.
		If the audio queue is tracking the default system device and the device changes, it will
		generate a property changed notification for this property. You can then query the HAL 
		for info on the new default system device.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_MagicCookie
        A read/write property whose value is an audio format magic cookie. If the audio format
        requires a magic cookie, you must set this property before enqueuing any buffers.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_MaximumOutputPacketSize
        A read-only UInt32 that indicates the size in bytes of the largest single packet of
        data in the output format. This is mostly useful for recording/encoding variable bit rate
        compressed data.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_StreamDescription
        A read-only AudioStreamBasicDescription that indicates the queue's recording format.
        This is useful when recording, where you may specify a sample rate of 0 during
        construction, 
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_ChannelLayout
        A read/write property whose value is an audio channel layout structure that describes
        the audio queue's channel layout. The number of channels must match the format of the
        queue. If more than two channels (for instance, a five-channel surround sound) exist in
        the queue, there may be a need to specify a channel layout. This layout indicates the
        specific order in which the channels do appear, such as left, then center, then right.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_EnableLevelMetering
        A read-write property whose value is a UInt32 that indicates whether metering of
        audio levels is enabled for the audio queue. (0=off, 1=on).
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter
        A read-only property whose value is an array of AudioQueueLevelMeter structures, one
        array element per audio channel. The values in the AudioQueueLevelMeters are in the
        range 0-1.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeterDB
        A read-only property whose value is an array of AudioQueueLevelMeter structures, one
        array element per audio channel. The values in the AudioQueueLevelMeters are in
        decibels.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_DecodeBufferSizeFrames
        A read/write property whose value is a UInt32 that is the size of the buffer into which
        an output audio queue decodes buffers. A large buffer provides more reliability and
        better long-term performance at the expense of memory and decreased responsiveness
        in some situations.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_ConverterError
        A read-only property whose value is a UInt32 indicating the most recent error (if any)
        encountered by the queue's internal encoding/decoding process.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_EnableTimePitch
        A read/write property whose value is a UInt32 describing whether there is a time/pitch unit
        inserted into the queue's audio signal chain. This property may only be set while
        the queue is stopped.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_TimePitchAlgorithm
        A read/write property whose value is a UInt32 describing the time/pitch algorithm in use.
        This property is only valid while a time/pitch has been inserted, and may only be changed
        when the queue is not running.
    @constant   kAudioQueueProperty_TimePitchBypass
        A read/write property whose value is a UInt32 describing whether the time/pitch unit
        has been bypassed (1=bypassed, 0=not bypassed).

@typedef    AudioQueueProcessingTapCallback
@abstract   A function called when an audio queue has data to be processed by its tap

@discussion
    A processing callback is invoked when the audio queue has data that can be processed by a given
    tap.

    The audio queue will call the processing callback when it has sufficient data to provide for
    processing.

    In the case of a siphoning tap, the callback function can inspect the audio data in ioData, but
    should not otherwise modify it. The callback should not call
    AudioQueueProcessingTapGetSourceAudio.

    A non-siphoning callback should call AudioQueueProcessingTapGetSourceAudio to request from the
    queue as much source data as it needs in order to produce the requested number of output
    samples. When the callback requests source data it may receive less data than it requests.

    In the case of a tap on an audio output queue, the tap must emit the exact number of sample
    frames that the queue requests. In normal circumstances, the tap's requests for source data will
    be satisfied (as the client running the audio queue is also providing the queue with the audio
    source material). If there is insufficient source data available (this is indicated by the
    outNumberFrames from the GetSource call), then the processing tap should deal as best as it can;
    it can either return less data than was requested or insert silence, noise, etc. itself. If it
    returns less data than requested, the hosting audio queue will fill in the remainder with
    silence.

    In the case of a tap on an audio input queue, the tap may provide back less audio data than is
    being requested. Typically this will occur because the tap will ask for source data that is not
    available at this time (the audio input hasn't arrived yet), so the tap should cache the source
    data that it needs and return as many processed samples as it can. If the processing tap falls
    behind and is not providing data quickly enough silence will be generated in the data provided
    to the client (and there is no signal about this either).

    A processing tap executes in a semi-real-time context, so the general limitations for real-time
    processing apply. Avoid using API's which may block. In particular, it is not safe to call the
    audio queue on which the tap was installed, with the exceptions of
    AudioQueueProcessingTapGetSourceAudio and AudioQueueProcessingTapGetQueueTime.

    In normal operation the source data will be continuous from the last time the callback was
    called and the processed samples should be continuous from the previous samples returned. If
    there is any discontinuity between the last samples provided for processing the audio queue will
    set the bit for kAudioQueueProcessing_StartOfStream in the inFlags. After a discontinuity the
    first sample that the processing tap outputs should correspond to the first sample that was
    provided in the source samples (so a reset and then consequent process serves to re-anchor a
    relationship between the processing tap's source and processed samples). In this case the
    processing tap will typically discard any previous state (for instance, if a processing tap was
    adding a reverb to a signal, then the discontinuity flag would act the same as AudioUnitReset;
    any previous source information in the processing tap should be discarded).

    The caller is responsible for absorbing any processing delays. For example, if the processing is
    to be done by an audio unit that reports a processing latency, then the caller should remove
    those latency samples from the audio unit's rendering and not return them to the audio queue.

    The processing tap is able to operate on the provided source data in place (that is, it can do
    "in place processing") and return pointers to that buffer rather than its own. This works in a
    similar way as AudioUnit render operations.

    When an output audio queue is being stopped asynchronously, the processing tap will see the
    kAudioQueueProcessingTap_EndOfStream bit set on return from GetSourceAudio, and is responsible
    for propagating this bit from the callback when its processing has reached this point.

    A processing tap will NEVER see the same source data again, so, it should keep its own copy if
    it needs to keep it for further reference past the duration of this call. It also cannot assume
    that the pointers to the source data that it retrieves will remain valid AFTER the processing
    tap has executed.

    The processing tap should ensure that the data pointers it provides in outProcessedData remain
    valid until the tap is executed again.

    A processing tap is destroyed implicitly when its audio queue is disposed. It may also be
    removed explicitly, via AudioQueueProcessingTapDispose.

        You can exert some control of the buffer queue by using this function. You can assign
        audio queue settings that are in effect carried by an audio queue buffer as you enqueue
        it. Hence, these changes only take effect when an audio queue buffer begins playing.
        
        This function queues a buffer for playback only, not for recording. Audio queues for
        recording have no parameters, do not support variable-bit-rate (VBR) formats (which
        might require trimming), and have a different way to handle timing. When queued for
        playback, the buffer must contain the audio data to be played back. See
        AudioQueueEnqueueBuffer for details on queuing a buffer for recording.

        If the buffer was allocated with AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions,
        the client should provide packet descriptions in the buffer's mPacketDescriptions

    @param      inNumPacketDescs
        The number of packet descriptions pointed to by the inPacketDescs parameter. Required

        changed while the buffer is playing. How accurately changes in parameters can be
        scheduled depends on the size of the buffer. If there are no parameters to set
        (inNumParamValues = 0), pass NULL.
    @param      inStartTime
        A pointer to a structure containing the desired start time for playing the buffer. If
        you specify the time using the mSampleTime field of the AudioTimeStamp structure, the
        sample time is relative to the time the queue started. If you pass NULL for the start
        time, the buffer starts immediately after the previously queued buffer, or as soon as
        possible if no buffers are queued ahead of it. Buffers are played in the order they are
        queued. If multiple buffers are queued, their times must be in ascending order or NULL;
        otherwise, an error occurs. The start time indicates when the actual audio data in the
        buffer is to be played (that is, the trim frames are not counted).

        If you pass true, the stop request occurs immediately (that is, synchronously), and the
        function returns when the audio queue has stopped. Buffer callbacks are invoked during
        the stopping. If you pass false, the function returns immediately, but the queue does
        not stop until all its queued buffers are played or filled (that is, the stop occurs
        asynchronously). Buffer callbacks are invoked as necessary until the queue actually
        stops. Also, a playback audio queue callback calls this function when there is no more
        audio to play.

    @function   AudioQueueProcessingTapNew

    @discussion
                This function creates a processing tap on a given audio queue. A
                processing tap can only be established (or removed) on an audio queue that is
                stopped (paused is not sufficient). The processing tap will then be used to
                process either decoded data in the case of an output queue, or input data
                (before it is encoded) in the case of an input queue.

                The processing is performed on audio either before or after any effects or other
                processing (varispeed, etc) is applied by the audio queue, depending on inFlags.
    
    @param      inAQ    
                    The audio queue from which to create the processing tap
    @param      inCallback
                    A callback which the queue will call to process the audio
    @param      inClientData
                    Client data provided to the callback
    @param      inFlags
                    Flags that are used to control aspects of the processing tap.
                    Valid flags are:
                        - kAudioQueueProcessingTap_PreEffects: processing is done before any
                            further effects are applied by the audio queue to the audio
                        - kAudioQueueProcessingTap_PostEffects: processing is done after all
                            processing is done, including that of other taps.
                        - kAudioQueueProcessingTap_Siphon
    @param      outMaxFrames
                    The maximum number of sample frames that can be requested of a processing
                    tap at any one time. Typically this will be approximately 50 msec of audio
                    (2048 samples @ 44.1kHz)
    @param      outProcessingFormat
                    The format in which the client will receive the audio data to be processed.
                    This will always be the same sample rate as the client format and usually
                    the same number of channels as the client format of the audio queue. (NOTE:
                    the number of channels may be different in some cases if the client format
                    has some channel count restrictions, for instance the client provides 5.1
                    AAC, but the decoder can only produce stereo). The channel order, if the
                    same as the client format, will be the same as the client channel order. If
                    the channel count is changed, it will be to either 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo, in
                    which case the first channel is left, the second right).

                    If the data is not in a convenient format for the client to process in, then
                    the client should convert the data to and from that format. This is the most
                    efficient mechanism to use (as the audio queue can chose a format that is
                    most efficient from its playback (or recording) requirement.
