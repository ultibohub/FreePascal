# Human 68k Units

This directory contains OS API units for Human68k, which is an MSDOS-alike
operating system developed by Hudson Soft, running on the Sharp X68000
series of computers. They're sometimes called the "Japanese Amiga", due
to their Motorola 68000 processor and strong custom chipset for graphics.

This package is named "h68units" instead of "h68kunits" due to the 8.3
limitations of the original platform.

The code in this package is based on code and information found in the GCC
and newlib ports for Human68k by Lyderic "Lydux" Maillet, and is available
at:
